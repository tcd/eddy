    description: "This is a reference assigned to identify implementation convention (similar to Version Number in GS08). The reason for this element is that some translators do not let you map to ISA and GS segments. This element will allow a user to map to the version number (e.g. 005010X222A1) if needed. The ST-03 will always take precedence over GS08."
    description: "The ST03 element was added to all of the above transactions.  This element contains the same value as GS08.  Some EDI translation products omit the ISA and GS segments (envelopes) prior to application (ST-SE) processing.  By providing the information from GS08 at this level, it will ensure that the appropriate application mapping is used at translation time."
